# Project-48-Sublime-Limes-Line-Graphs-Data-Visualization-with-MatPlotLib
In this project, you will be acting as a data analyst for an online lime retailer called Sublime Limes. People all over the world can use this product to get the freshest, best-quality limes delivered to their door. One of the product managers at Sublime Limes would like to gain insight into the customers and their sales habits. Using Matplotlib, you’ll create some different line graphs (or maybe, lime graphs) to communicate this information effectively.
